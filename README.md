# A Programming Language Made with Love 💗

## Warning ⚠️

You will fall in love with this language. 😍

## Let's learn what is love 💖

### Print "I love you" in console

You have to be polit. Print is not enough. You have to say it. So, you have to use `say` keyword.

```love
say "I love you"
```

## How to make love 💕

- clone this repo
- go to the project folder: `cd love`
- run `pnpm install`
  - if you don't have pnpm, install it with `npm i -g pnpm`
- run `pnpm test`
  - this will run a sample love code in [test.love](./test/test.love) file

Add more love to [test.love](./test/test.love) file and run `pnpm test` again to make love.  
Or press `F5` in VSCode.
