# A Programming Language Made with Love 💗

## Warning ⚠️

You will fall in love with this language. 😍

## Let's learn what is love 💖

### Print "I love you" in console

You have to be polit. Print is not enough. You have to say it. So, you have to use `say` keyword.

```love
say "I love you"
```

### Create loved ones

You can create loved ones with `love` keyword.

```love
love name as a string
love age as a number
```

You have to zone your loved ones. I know it is bad but we do it anyway. There are 2 types of zones

- number
- string

### Change loved ones

When you love someone, you can easily change them.

```love
name is "Jane"
age is 21
```

## How to make love 💕

- clone this repo
- go to the project folder: `cd love`
- run `pnpm install`
  - if you don't have pnpm, install it with `npm i -g pnpm`
- run `pnpm test`
  - this will run a sample love code in [test.love](./test/test.love) file

Add more love to [test.love](./test/test.love) file and run `pnpm test` again to make love.  
Or press `F5` in VSCode.

## A sample relationship 👨‍❤️‍👩🧑‍❤️‍👨👩‍❤️‍👩

```love
love action as a string
love her as a string
love magnitude as a number

action is "Love"
her is "☀️ "
magnitude is 1000

say action her magnitude "times"
```

output:

```
Love ☀️ 1000 times
```
